In order for this application to be used (and for VueJS to be used in general), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) will need to be installed on your system.

Once these are installed through the use of the NPM command line or using a compliant software such as "VisualStudio - Code" the VueJS application can be launched.

- In the NPM CLI this will be achieved by navigating to the root path of the VueJS project and running the scripts `npm install` (if not already done), `npm` and finally `npm run serve`.
- In "VisualStudio - Code" this same proccess can be achieved once Node.js and NPM are installed, only by opening the root folder as a project space in the text editor and then using the build in NPM functions below the folder display, also following the `npm run serve` action.

Once one of these processes has been completed a local IP address will be assigned and communicated back, allowing for the application to be accessed locally via a browser. (Normally this will be auto assigned to localhost:8080)
